# ACME Configuration

There are two ACME components that must be configured before you can begin 
using the application.

The first is an ACME Server and the second is a Challenge Solver.

## ACME Servers

ACME Servers are the remote entities that actually issue certificates to you
via the ACME specification.

By default, Cert Warden includes the Let's Encrypt production and staging servers. 
See [ACME Servers](/docs/user_interface/acme_servers) for details on how to 
change this.

## Challenge Solver

Challenge Solvers facilitate the process of proving control over the domain 
you're requesting a certificate for.

By default Cert Warden serves http-01 challenges over an http server on port 4070. 
See [Providers (Challenge Solvers)](/docs/user_interface/providers) for 
details on how to change this.
