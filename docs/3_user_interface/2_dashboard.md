# Dashboard

The dashboard shows all current, valid certificates, what their primary subject 
is, any special flags, and their expiration.

Essentially this is a good high level overview of the certificates LeGo is 
providing.

Clicking on a certificate name will take you to that certificate's page.

Additionally, the icon in the top right corner (present on all pages of the 
Web UI, except Login) is the logout button.
