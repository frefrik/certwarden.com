# ACME Servers

## Viewing Servers

`ACME Servers` shows all of the configured ACME Servers. It also provides options
to add, edit, or delete them.

## Adding Servers

To add a server, click `New Server`.

:::note
The checkbox for `Staging Environment Server` doesn't change functional behavior, 
it just applies a visual label to easily distinguish what type of environment 
your accounts and certificates are tied to. You should set this based on what kind 
of directory you're adding.
