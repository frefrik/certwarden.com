# dns-01 Cloudflare

LeGo has native support for Cloudflare as a DNS provider.

There are two options to configure Cloudflare. You can either create 
a scoped API Token or use a Global API Key.

## Configuration

As with all providers, domains that should use this provider must be 
specified. One wildcard provider can be configured with a sole 
domain of `*` which will be used if LeGo doesn't find a domain 
name on any other provider.

Then use the dropdown box to select one of the two below options.

### Scoped API Token

This is the preferred option as compromise of the token will only result in 
a partial compromise of the related account. Additionally, there is no reason
to give LeGo complete access to a Cloudflare account.

### Global API Key

This options involves using a Cloudflare account's global key which gives 
full and complete access to the account.

:::caution
Due to the breadth of access this key grants, it is **STRONGLY** recommended you 
**DO NOT** use this option.

You will need to input the account's email address and API Key.
